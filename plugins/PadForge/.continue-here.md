# Resume Point

## Current State: Creative Brief Complete

Creative brief has been finalized for PadForge. Ready to proceed to UI mockup or implementation.

## Completed So Far

**Ideation:** ✓ Complete
- Core concept defined: Randomizable pad generator with hidden parameters
- Parameters specified: 4 visible controls + ~40 hidden randomizable parameters
- UI vision captured: Minimal interface with randomize button and preset system
- Use cases identified: Rapid pad discovery, ambient/experimental production

## Next Steps

1. Create UI mockup to visualize design (recommended)
2. Start implementation directly
3. Research similar plugins for inspiration

## Context to Preserve

**Key Decisions:**
- Plugin type: Synth (Instrument)
- Core concept: 3-oscillator subtractive synth with extensive hidden modulation, controlled via randomize button
- Visible controls: Volume, Brightness, Space (reverb), Randomize Amount
- Randomization: Iterative refinement via "Randomize Amount" knob that scales deviation from current state
- Sonic goal: Lush, complete pads that don't need external effects
- Target genre: Ambient/experimental

**Files Created:**
