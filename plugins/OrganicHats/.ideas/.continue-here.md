# Resume Point

## Current State: UI Design In Progress

UI mockup v1 created using Studio Hardware aesthetic. Design iteration phase - awaiting finalization.

## Completed So Far

**Ideation:** ✓ Complete
- Core concept defined: Warm, organic noise-based hi-hat synth with closed/open sounds
- Parameters specified: 8 parameters (3 per hi-hat type + 2 global velocity controls)
- UI vision captured: Dual-panel layout with separate closed/open sections

**UI Design:** In Progress (v1)
- Aesthetic applied: Studio Hardware (studio-hardware-001)
- Layout: Dual-panel with global section (700x500px)
- Files created: v1-ui.yaml, v1-ui-test.html
- Status: Design iteration (not finalized)

## Next Steps

Decision menu presented:
1. Check alignment - Run design-sync validation
2. Provide refinements - Iterate on design (creates v2)
3. Finalize and create implementation files
4. Save as aesthetic template
5. Finalize AND save aesthetic
6. Test in browser (open v1-ui-test.html)
7. Validate WebView constraints
8. Other

## Context to Preserve

**Key Decisions:**
- Plugin type: Synth (Instrument)
- Core concept: Noise-based hi-hat synthesis with fixed resonance peaks for warmth
- MIDI triggering: Different notes for closed (C1) and open (D1)
- Choke behavior: Closed always chokes open with instant (<5ms) cutoff
- Synthesis: Filtered noise with static generation (no random variation)
- Velocity: Affects both volume and tone brightness
- Inspiration: CR-78/808 but warmer and less metallic
- Aesthetic: Studio Hardware (professional 19" rack unit with industrial precision)
