# Resume Point

## Current State: UI Mockup v1 Created

UI mockup v1 has been generated and committed. Design iteration in progress.

## Completed So Far

**Ideation:** ✓ Complete
- Core concept defined: Text-to-MIDI polymetric sequencer
- Parameters specified: Transpose (keyswitches), Density, Dynamics, Bloom, Scale/Root/Octave
- UI vision captured: 8 text line slots, color-coded channels, minimal typewriter aesthetic

**UI Mockup v1:** ✓ Complete
- Window: 700×550px (fixed size)
- Layout: 8 text lines with channel color badges
- Controls: Transpose slider + 8 presets, Density/Dynamics/Bloom knobs
- Musical foundation: Scale/Root/Octave selectors, Tempo display
- Aesthetic: Vintage typewriter with cream text area on dark gray
- Files: v1-ui.yaml, v1-ui-test.html

## Next Steps

1. Iterate on UI design (create v2 with refinements)
2. Finalize mockup and proceed to implementation
3. Start implementation with current design

## Context to Preserve

**Key Decisions:**
- Plugin type: Utility (MIDI Sequencer)
- Core concept: Type text lines → each becomes independent polymetric MIDI loop
- Letter-to-pitch algorithm: Letter sum % 7 → scale degree
- 8 simultaneous lines maximum (focused layering)
- Global sync mode (loops align to DAW grid)
- Instant regeneration on text edit
- MIDI keyswitch transpose presets (C3-G3)
- Bloom filter affects pitch spreading + velocity variation
