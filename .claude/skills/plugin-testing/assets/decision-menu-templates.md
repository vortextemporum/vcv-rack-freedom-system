How would you like to test {PLUGIN_NAME}?

1. Automated stability tests (~2 min)
   → Quick C++ unit tests (requires Tests/ directory)
   → Validates core functionality and edge cases
   → Best for: plugins with test infrastructure

2. Build + pluginval (~5-10 min) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
   → Industry-standard validation at strictness level 10
   → Tests VST3 and AU formats
   → Catches 99% of issues before DAW testing
   → Required before distribution

3. Manual DAW testing (~30-60 min)
   → Hands-on testing in your DAW
   → Custom checklist based on plugin features
   → Best for: final validation and sound quality checks

4. Skip testing (NOT RECOMMENDED)
   → Proceed to installation without validation
   → Use only if you've already tested externally
