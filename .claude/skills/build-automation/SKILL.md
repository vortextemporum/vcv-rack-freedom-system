## Success Criteria

This skill succeeds when:
1. Build script executes and returns exit code
2. Build result communicated to user (success or failure message)
3. Log file path displayed
4. Context-appropriate decision menu presented
5. User choice captured and executed
6. Control returned to invoking skill

This skill fails when:
- Module directory doesn't exist
- Build script not found or not executable
- User chooses "Wait" and doesn't resume (partial success - workflow paused intentionally)

## Purpose

Orchestrates module builds via `scripts/build-and-install.sh` with comprehensive failure handling.

**Invokers:** plugin-workflow (Stages 2-5), plugin-improve (Phase 7), plugin-lifecycle (verification)
**Invokes:** build script, troubleshooter agent (on failure, user option 1)

**Key behaviors:**
- Context-aware build flags (Stage 2 uses `--no-install`, others full build)
- Structured 5-option failure menu (never auto-retry)
- Context-specific success menus (different per stage)
- Always returns control to invoker (never continues autonomously)

## Context Mechanism

When invoked, this skill receives context via invocation parameters:

```json
{
  "plugin_name": "ModuleName",
  "stage": 0 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | null,  // Stage numbers: 0=Planning, 2=Foundation, 3=DSP, 4=GUI, 5=Validation
  "invoker": "plugin-workflow" | "plugin-improve" | "plugin-lifecycle" | "manual",
  "build_flags": ["--no-install"] | ["--dry-run"] | []
}
```

**Context is preserved throughout skill execution:**
- Stored at skill entry (before entering Build Workflow)
- Reused on retry without re-prompting user
- Determines build flags, success menu, and return behavior

**Manual invocation detection:**
- When `invoker: "manual"` (user says "build ModuleName" directly without workflow context)
- Prompt: "Use --dry-run to preview build commands? (y/n)"
- No stage-specific success menu (generic completion message only)

<workflow name="build_workflow">

## Build Workflow

When invoked, the build-automation skill follows this workflow:

### Build Workflow Progress Checklist

Copy this checklist to track your progress:

```
Build Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Input validation
- [ ] Step 2: Determine build flags
- [ ] Step 3: Invoke build script
- [ ] Step 4: Monitor build output
- [ ] Step 5: Capture exit code
- [ ] Step 6: Execute success/failure protocol
```

### 1. Input Validation

- Verify module name provided
- Check module directory exists: `test -d "plugins/$MODULE_NAME"`
- Validate Makefile present: `test -f "plugins/$MODULE_NAME/Makefile"`

### 2. Determine Build Flags

Context-aware flag selection:

- **Stage 2 (Foundation)**: Always use `--no-install` flag (verify compilation only, no installation)
- **Stages 3-5 (DSP/GUI/Validation)**: Full build with installation (no flags)
- **plugin-improve**: Full build with installation (no flags)
- **Manual invocation** (`invoker: "manual"`): Ask if they want `--dry-run` to preview commands

### 3. Invoke Build Script

Execute build script with appropriate flags:

```bash
./scripts/build-and-install.sh [ModuleName] [flags]
```

Display build progress in real-time using Bash tool.

### 4. Monitor Build Output

- Capture stdout and stderr
- Display progress messages to user
- Watch for error indicators
- Track build duration

### 5. Capture Exit Code

Check build script exit code:

- **Exit 0**: Build succeeded → proceed to Success Protocol
- **Exit 1**: Build failed → proceed to Failure Protocol

### 6. Log File Location

Always show log file path after build attempt:

```
Build log: logs/[ModuleName]/build_TIMESTAMP.log
```

User can review full build output from log file if needed.

</workflow>

<decision_gate name="build_failure_handling" blocking="true">

## Failure Protocol

When build fails (exit code 1):

1. Extract error from log (last 50 lines or first error indicator)
2. Present structured menu (see menu structure below)
3. WAIT for user choice (NEVER auto-proceed)
4. Execute chosen option

**Iterative Debugging Loop**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Present failure menu        │
│ ↓                           │
│ Wait for user choice        │
│ ↓                           │
│ Execute option 1-3          │
│ ↓                           │
│ Return to menu (loop)       │ ← Continue until user chooses option 4 (Wait) or 5 (Other/abort)
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

Menu structure:
```
⚠️ Build failed

What would you like to do?
1. Investigate - Run troubleshooter agent (recommended)
2. Show me the build log - Display full build output
3. Show me the code - Open source files with error
4. Wait - I'll fix manually
5. Other
```

**Option Actions** (summary - full details in references/failure-protocol.md):

1. **Investigate**: Invoke troubleshooter agent via Task tool with build log context → display findings → re-present menu
2. **Show build log**: Display full log contents with highlighted error section → re-present menu
3. **Show code**: Extract file/line from error, display relevant code section (±5 lines) → re-present menu
4. **Wait**: Exit skill, preserve context for retry (user says "retry build" when ready) → do NOT re-present menu
5. **Other**: Capture custom action (retry, skip, abort, or execute specific instruction)

**Menu Loop**:
- Options 1-3: Execute action, then re-present menu (iterative debugging)
- Option 4: Exit skill cleanly (workflow paused)
- Option 5: Execute user's choice, behavior depends on instruction

</decision_gate>

<decision_gate name="build_success_handling" blocking="false">

## Success Protocol

When build succeeds (exit code 0), follow this workflow:

### 1. Verify Success

- Confirm build script exit code 0
- Check log contains "Phase 7: Verification" success message
- Extract installed plugin locations from script output

### 2. Display Success Message

Use this template:

```
✓ Build successful

Built and installed:
- .vcvplugin: ~/Documents/Rack2/plugins/.vcvplugin/[ProductName].vcvplugin
-  ~/Documents/Rack2/plugins/Components/[ProductName]

Build time: [duration]
Log: logs/[ModuleName]/build_TIMESTAMP.log
```

For `--no-install` builds (Stage 2):

```
✓ Build successful (compilation verified, not installed)

Built artifacts:
- .vcvplugin: plugins/[ModuleName]/build/[ModuleName]_artefacts/Release/.vcvplugin/[ProductName].vcvplugin
-  plugins/[ModuleName]/build/[ModuleName]_artefacts/Release/AU/[ProductName]

Build time: [duration]
Log: logs/[ModuleName]/build_TIMESTAMP.log
```

### 3. Commit Build Success

Before presenting decision menu, commit the successful build:

**If invoked from workflow** (plugin-workflow, plugin-improve):
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: build [ModuleName] successful"
```

**If manual invocation**: Skip commit (user manages their own git workflow)

### 4. Check Workflow Mode

Before presenting decision menu, check if auto-progression is configured:

1. **Check invoker type**: If `invoker: "plugin-workflow"`, read workflow mode from .claude/preferences.json
2. **Express mode**: Skip menu, exit immediately with SUCCESS status (auto-progression)
3. **Manual mode**: Present context-aware decision menu (Step 5)
4. **Manual invocation** (`invoker: "manual"`): Always present menu (no preferences check)

### 5. Context-Aware Decision Menu

Load context-appropriate menu from `assets/success-menus.md` based on `context.stage` parameter

<handoff_protocol name="return_to_invoker">

After user makes decision from success menu:

1. Identify invoking skill (stored at entry)
2. Return control using appropriate mechanism:
   - **plugin-workflow**: Exit with status SUCCESS, await stage dispatcher
   - **plugin-improve**: Exit with status SUCCESS, await improvement workflow
   - **Manual invocation**: Exit with final status message

**State update responsibility:**
- build-automation commits the successful build (Step 3 above)
- Invoking skill (plugin-workflow) handles .continue-here.md and PLUGINS.md updates
- Proper separation: build-automation handles build artifacts, orchestrator handles workflow state

NEVER continue workflow autonomously after success.
NEVER invoke next stage directly.
NEVER update .continue-here.md or PLUGINS.md (invoking skill's responsibility).
ALWAYS exit and let invoking skill/workflow orchestrate next action.

Exit the skill cleanly:
1. Do NOT invoke any other skills or agents
2. Do NOT continue to next stage
3. Do NOT update state files (.continue-here.md, PLUGINS.md)
4. Simply complete skill execution
5. The invoking skill/workflow will detect completion and proceed according to its own logic

</handoff_protocol>

## Integration Examples

## Error Handling Rules

<critical_rule name="never_auto_retry" enforcement="blocking">

**NEVER automatically retry a failed build without explicit user decision.**

When build fails:
1. MUST present failure menu (lines 99-112)
2. MUST await user choice
3. MUST NOT execute any retry logic autonomously

Violation consequences: User loses control of workflow, unexpected builds consume resources, debugging becomes impossible.

</critical_rule>

<state_requirement name="retry_context_preservation">

When user requests build retry after manual fix:

MUST preserve from original invocation:
- Build flags (`--no-install`, `--dry-run`, or none)
- Invoking skill (plugin-workflow, plugin-improve, manual)
- Invoking stage (Stage 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, or N/A)
- Last decision point (for return navigation)

Context is already stored from skill entry (see "Context Mechanism" section).
Reuse stored context on retry without re-prompting user.

</state_requirement>

### Handle Missing Dependencies

If build script fails with dependency errors (Make, Make, VCV Rack not found):

1. Display specific missing dependency
2. Provide installation command (e.g., "Install with: brew install make")
3. Suggest: "Run /setup command to validate full environment configuration"
4. After user installs, offer: "Retry build now?"

### Parse Errors Intelligently

Extract meaningful error information for troubleshooter:

- **Make errors**: Configuration issues, missing modules, path problems
- **Compilation errors**: Syntax, type mismatches, missing declarations
- **Linker errors**: Missing symbols, library issues
- **Installation errors**: Permission issues, path conflicts

Pass full context to troubleshooter, not just error message.
