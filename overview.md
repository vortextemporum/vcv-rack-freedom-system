# TACHES CLAUDE JUCE SYSTEM

## Overview

An AI-assisted plugin development system that enables conversational creation of professional VST3 and AU audio plugins for macOS. Using Claude Code, musicians and producers can design and build custom plugins through natural dialogue, without writing code.

## Why

Traditional plugin development requires deep knowledge of C++, DSP algorithms, and the JUCE framework—a barrier that keeps plugin creation restricted to experienced programmers. This system removes that barrier entirely.

By enabling conversational plugin development, this system:
- **Democratizes creation**: Anyone with a plugin idea can build it, regardless of technical background
- **Prioritizes creativity**: Focus on sonic goals and user experience, not implementation details
- **Accelerates iteration**: Ideas become working plugins in hours, not weeks
- **Removes gatekeeping**: Opens audio software development to producers, sound designers, and musicians

## What You Can Do

### Explore Ideas
Brainstorm plugin concepts through conversation. Describe what you want—a vintage tape delay, a granular synthesizer, a custom compressor—and the system helps you refine the concept into a detailed specification.

### Create Mockups
Design your plugin's interface using visual mockups. Experiment with layouts, controls, and aesthetics before any code is written. Iterate quickly until the design feels right.

### Build Plugins
Transform your ideas into fully functional plugins through an automated multi-stage workflow. The system handles all technical implementation—from DSP processing to parameter management to user interface rendering.

### Improve & Iterate
Enhance existing plugins with new features, fix bugs, or refine the user experience. The system maintains version history and makes improvements as simple as describing what you want changed.

## Modern Interface Design

Plugins built with this system use web-based interfaces (HTML/CSS) instead of traditional GUI frameworks. This approach enables:
- **Rapid prototyping**: See design changes instantly without rebuilding
- **Modern aesthetics**: Leverage contemporary web design patterns and styling
- **Interactive mockups**: Test and refine interfaces before implementation
- **Familiar tools**: Use web technologies many creators already understand

## Philosophy

This system treats plugin development as a creative conversation, not a coding task. You describe the sound, behavior, and appearance you want. The system handles the technical complexity, allowing you to focus on what matters: creating tools that serve your music.
