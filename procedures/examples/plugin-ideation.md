## Example 1: Full Interview with Checkpoint

```
Lex: I want to make a granular glitch effect

Claude: What would you like to build?

Lex: A granular glitch effect that manipulates audio buffers in real-time with chaotic but musical results

Claude: Let me make sure I understand:
- Type: Effect (granular processing)
- Core concept: Real-time buffer manipulation with grain-based glitching
- Sonic goal: Chaotic textures with musical sweet spots
- Parameters: {not specified yet}
- UI: {not mentioned}

What parameters do you need to control the granular processing?

Lex: Grain size, density, pitch scatter, and feedback

Claude: What about visual style - any preferences?

Lex: Dark experimental aesthetic with a waveform visualization showing the grains

Claude: **Summary so far:**
- Type: Audio Effect (granular glitch)
- Core concept: Real-time buffer manipulation with grain density control
- Sonic goal: Experimental/chaotic textures with musical sweet spots
- Key parameters: Grain size, density, pitch scatter, feedback
- UI vibe: Dark/experimental with waveform visualization

Want to explore more details about preset concepts and advanced features, or should I finalize the document now?

Lex: ask me about automation

Claude: Should the parameters support DAW automation?

Lex: Yes, full automation support and MIDI CC learn

Claude: **Updated summary:**
[...previous summary...]
- Automation: Full DAW automation support, MIDI CC learn for all parameters

Want to explore more, or finalize?

Lex: finalize

Claude: Created plugins/GranularGlitch/.ideas/creative-brief.md with your vision.

Want to start building GranularGlitch now? I'll kick off the plugin-workflow with Stage 0 research.
